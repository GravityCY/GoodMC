# GoodMC

A Fabric Mod that I basically just made to make Minecraft the way I like it with some alright ideas here and there :)

## Shulker Recursion Enchant
### Allows for shulker boxes to hold shulker boxes (Depth of 1)
- Shulker box items inside a Shulker box can be right-clicked to open its inventory while your in the Other Shulker
- Spawns in Bastion Treasure Chests (90%)

## Shulker Affinity Enchant
### Makes players immune to the levitation effect from shulker bullets
- Spawns in End City Treasure Chests (10%)

<br>

## Realistic Lanterns
### Lanterns now render as if you're holding them with your hand in First Person
Adds a Keybind, the default being `left_alt`, to find a lantern in your inventory and put it in your offhand

> When swinging your arm with the lantern it can look goofy at times because I couldn't get the swing animation to work with the way I've done it

## Open in Wiki
### A command to open minecraft related stuff in https://minecraft.fandom.com with your default browser
`/wiki`<br><br>
Example<br>
`/wiki grass block` will effectively launch your browser at https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Block

<br>

## Visually Aging Mobs
### In Vanilla, mobs that turn into an adult version of themselves, visually, they just do it instantly, they just... instantaneously .. become an adult, like huh?
### With Visually Aging Mobs I've achieved this... but with a flaw
 Right now the client can never know the actual age of a mob because the server doesn't send that information, so right now the client just assumes the age from how long the entity has been loaded by the client ðŸ¤·<br><br>
I'm pretty sure eventually I can make the server tell the client the age but for now it is what it is.

## Angry Mobs
### Zombies / Skeletons that can pickup items now have a different texture
- Can be Customized with Resource Packs
    - Texture location is at
      - goodmc/textures/entity/zombie/angry_zombie.png
      - goodmc/textures/entity/skeleton/angry_skeleton.png

## Budding Amethyst
- Budding Amethyst will now drop when exploded by Creepers
- Budding Amethyst is now <b>pushable</b> by pistons
- Budding Amethyst is now slower to mine (Hardness of 20)
- Compasses freak out whenever you're above or below a geode

## Structure Locator
### Compasses can now be used to locate structures
Using an item found in most structures (it will always spawn 1 per structure)
in a smithing table with a compass will randomly roll a structure the compass will be 
pointing to within a certain distance

### Custom View Bobbing Strength
Minecraft has either View Bobbing on or View Bobbing off, but what if 
you like it but just want it to be less strong, well that's what this does

## Things I want to add...
> A Todo List

> Better Mob Aging 

> Make a library for Enchantable Blocks (KINDA DONE)<br> 
> This could also fix the fact that you can't use this mod with EnchantedShulkers

> Add integration with Reinforced Shulkers (KINDA DONE)
